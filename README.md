**Job Search Tips**

Update your LinkedIn status to "Open to Work" (visible to recruiters only) — this significantly increases inbound interest.
Be specific about what you want — job title, tech stack, company size, remote vs hybrid. The clearer you are, the better matches you'll get.
Referrals still win — a warm introduction beats a cold application almost every time. Invest in your network.
Apply early — many startups close roles fast. If a job has been posted more than 2 weeks, check if it's still active before applying.
Quality over quantity — 10 tailored applications beat 100 generic ones.


**Interview Prep**
**General Tips**

Research the company's product, recent funding, and team on LinkedIn and Crunchbase before any interview.
Prepare 3–5 strong examples using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for behavioural questions.
Always prepare 2–3 thoughtful questions to ask at the end — it shows genuine interest.

**Technical Interviews**

Practice on LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars
Review system design fundamentals for senior roles — System Design Primer is excellent
Talk through your thinking out loud — interviewers want to see your reasoning, not just your answer

**For Data & AI Roles**

Brush up on statistics, probability, and ML fundamentals
Be ready to walk through past projects end-to-end (data collection → model → impact)
Know your SQL — it comes up in almost every data interview

**For Product & Design Roles**

Practice product case questions (e.g. "How would you improve Spotify?")
Be ready to present your portfolio and walk through your design decisions
Know your metrics — retention, engagement, NPS, conversion


**Salary & Offers**

Always negotiate — a first offer is rarely a final offer. Most hiring managers expect it.
Research market rates on Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn Salary
Total compensation matters — base salary, equity, bonus, benefits, and flexibility all count
Don't reveal your current salary if you can avoid it — focus on your target instead
If you have competing offers, use them as leverage (professionally and honestly)


**CV & Portfolio Advice**

Keep your CV to 1–2 pages max — recruiters spend seconds on a first scan
Lead with impact, not tasks — "Increased API response time by 40%" beats "Responsible for API optimisation"
Tailor your CV for each role — mirror the language in the job description
For engineers: link to your GitHub, a live project, or a portfolio site
For designers: your portfolio is everything — make sure it's up to date and loads fast

**Working With Recruiters**

Be honest about your situation — notice period, competing offers, salary expectations. It helps us help you.
Give feedback after interviews — even brief feedback helps us advocate for you better
Respond promptly — startup hiring moves fast; delays can cost you the role
Ask questions — a good recruiter should be able to tell you about the team, culture, and role in detail
It's a two-way street — you're evaluating the company as much as they're evaluating you
